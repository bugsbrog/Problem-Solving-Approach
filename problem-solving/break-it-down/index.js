// Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string.

function charCount(str) {
    // do something
    // return an object with keys that are lowercase alphanumeric characters in the string; values should be the counts for those characters
}

function charCount(str) {
    // make object to return at end
    // loop over string, for each character...
    // if the char is a number/letter AND is a key in object, add one to count
    // if the char is a number/letter AND not in object, add it to object and set value to 1
    // if character is something else (space, punctuation, etc.), don't do anything
    // return object at end
}
